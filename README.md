LibOPT-old
======

LibOPT-old is an optimization library developed in C language for the development of meta-heuristic-based applications. Currently, we have the following techniques implemented and tested:

* Particle Swarm Optimization [1]
* Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Inertia Weight [2]
* Bat Algorithm [3]
* Harmony Search []
* Improved Harmony Search []
* Global-best Harmony Search []
* Self-Adaptive Global-best Harmony Search []
* Parameter-Setting-Free Harmony Search []
* Novel Global Harmony Search []
* Firefly Algorithm []

Additionally, the library also implements the following procedures:

* Restricted Boltzmann Machines fine-tuning parameters with Contrastive Divergence, Persistent Contrastive Divergence and Fast Persistent Contrastive Digervence []
* Deep Belief Networks fine-tuning parameters with Contrastive Divergence, Persistent Contrastive Divergence and Fast Persistent Contrastive Digervence []
* Deep Boltzmann Machines fine-tuning parameters with Contrastive Divergence []
* Feature selection []
