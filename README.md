LibOPT
======

LibOPT is an optimization library developed in C language for the development of meta-heuristic-based applications. Currently, we have the following techniques implemented and tested:

* Particle Swarm Optimization [1]
* Bat Algorithm [2]
* Harmony Search []
* Improved Harmony Search []
* Global-best Harmony Search []
* Self-Adaptive Global-best Harmony Search []
* Parameter-Setting-Free Harmony Search []
* Novel Global Harmony Search []

Additionally, the library also implements the following procedures:

* Deep Belief Networks fine-tuning parameters []
