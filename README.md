LibOPT
======

LibOPT is an optimization library developed in C language for the development of meta-heuristic-based applications. Currently, we have the following techniques implemented and tested:

* Particle Swarm Optimization [1] - naïve version
* Bat Algorithm [2]
* Harmony Search [] - naïve version
* Improved Harmony Search []
* Global-best Harmony Search []
* Self-Adaptive Global-best Harmony Search []
* Parameter-Setting-Free Harmony Search []
* Novel Global Harmony Search []
